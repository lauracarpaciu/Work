## Scoping

In this project, I'll use an existing prototype to identify ways to improve the system's performance iteratively. 
I'll implement some of the key techniques, like establishing a baseline or ensuring a balanced train/dev/test split and performing error analysis to prioritize what to work on. 
I'll also track experiments, including metrics so I can monitor  progress in improving the model. 
Finally, I'll deploy the model using Tensorflow Serving.
